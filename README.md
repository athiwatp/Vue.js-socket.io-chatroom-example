# Vue.js-socket.io-chatroom-example
This example application consists of a public chat room made with Vue.js, socket.io and Semantic UI. The backend websockets chat server is found inside the **chatServer.js** file. All Vue.js and front-end files are found inside **./vue**.

The project does by no means display "best practices" or try to showcase the most effective way of dealing with socket.io and Vue.js. It's merely an example to give people an idea of how Vue.js and socket.io can be used for interactive real time applications. I have no plans of putting this code into production, whereas I haven't put much effort into good commenting, testing and refactoring. 

## Demo

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run "npm install" in the root directory.
3. Run "npm install" in the "vue" directory.
4. While still in the vue directory, run "npm run build". This will generate the app.js file. You'll get three jslint "no-undef" errors, just ignore these. 
5. Navigate back to the root directory and start the application with "node webServer.js". 

## Known bugs
* If you add too many chat sessions the "session menu" bar will get too large and it will not be displayed correctly
